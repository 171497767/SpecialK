     problems when the CBT hook inevitably tries to re-inject the DLL.

0.8.12:

 + Removed legacy command console code (low-level keyboard hook, message pump)

 + Optional dgVoodoo support added, place the (all 32-bit) DLLs in
     Documents\My Mods\Special K\PlugIns\ThirdParty\dgVoodoo\
 + Fixed-up floating-point exception handling in Prey
