 + Added support for resolutions as low as 1280x720 and 1024x768

0.8.12.1:
 + Added 1.5 second delay unload for blacklisted applications to prevent performance
     problems when the CBT hook inevitably tries to re-inject the DLL.

0.8.12:
 + Removed legacy command console code (low-level keyboard hook, message pump)
 + Removed FreeLibrary hook, memory leaks in other software were being caught
     while debugging... it was obnoxious ;)
 + Fixed SteamAPI_Init being called instead of SteamAPI_Init_Detour
 + Fixed DirectDraw issues in Disgaea2 (presumably for video playback)
 + Fixed LoadLibraryW unhook during shutdown (had been unhooking LoadLibraryA)

     mouse input non-cooperatively.
 + Added support for wrapping d3d8.dll, no native renderer exists or ever will,
     the project relies on optional third-party API wrappers for legacy APIs.
 + Optional dgVoodoo support added, place the (all 32-bit) DLLs in
     Documents\My Mods\Special K\PlugIns\ThirdParty\dgVoodoo\
 + Fixed-up floating-point exception handling in Prey
