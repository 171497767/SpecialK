+ Fixed DirectDraw issues in Disgaea2 (presumably for video playback)
+ Fixed LoadLibraryW unhook during shutdown (had been unhooking LoadLibraryA)
+ Disabled relative mouse move in NieR: Automata - it always sends legacy input
+ Fixed problems dispatching keyboard input early from PeekMessage caused
    in Mass Effect: Andromeda
+ Added pirate tooltips to EULA ;)
+ Added resolution warning to EULA screen
+ Fixed license text truncation on EULA screen
+ Added code to compensate for games that pull WM_KEYDOWN messages out of the
    pump by using PeekMessage* with PM_REMOVE set.
+ Enabled relative mouse motion from RawInput in any game that tries to capture
    mouse input non-cooperatively.
+ Added support for wrapping d3d8.dll, no native renderer exists or ever will,
    the project relies on optional third-party API wrappers for legacy APIs.
+ Optional dgVoodoo support added, place the (all 32-bit) DLLs in
    Documents\My Mods\Special K\PlugIns\ThirdParty\dgVoodoo\
+ Fixed-up floating-point exception handling in Prey
