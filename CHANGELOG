0.8.12.2:
 + Added a D3D9 ForceWindowed override to SpecialK.ini
 + Fixed SteamAPI exception handling in 32-bit ABI (Steam overlay callback)
 + Fixed double-input processing through PeekMessage
 + Fixed CEGUI / ImGui reset on multi-frame D3D9 device loss recovery

0.8.12.1:
 + Added 1.5 second delay unload for blacklisted applications to prevent performance
     problems when the CBT hook inevitbly tries to re-inject the DLL.

0.8.12:
 + Removed legacy command console code (low-level keyboard hook, message pump)
 + Removed FreeLibrary hook, memory leaks in other software were being caught
     while debugging... it was obnoxious ;)
 + Fixed SteamAPI_Init being called instead of SteamAPI_Init_Detour
 + Fixed DirectDraw issues in Disgaea2 (presumably for video playback)
 + Fixed LoadLibraryW unhook during shutdown (had been unhooking LoadLibraryA)
 + Disabled relative mouse move in NieR: Automata - it always sends legacy input
 + Fixed problems dispatching keyboard input early from PeekMessage caused
     in Mass Effect: Andromeda
 + Added pirate tooltips to EULA ;)
 + Added resolution warning to EULA screen
 + Fixed license text truncation on EULA screen
 + Added code to compensate for games that pull WM_KEYDOWN messages out of the
     pump by using PeekMessage* with PM_REMOVE set.
 + Enabled relative mouse motion from RawInput in any game that tries to capture
     mouse input non-cooperatively.
 + Added support for wrapping d3d8.dll, no native renderer exists or ever will,
     the project relies on optional third-party API wrappers for legacy APIs.
 + Optional dgVoodoo support added, place the (all 32-bit) DLLs in
     Documents\My Mods\Special K\PlugIns\ThirdParty\dgVoodoo\
 + Fixed-up floating-point exception handling in Prey
